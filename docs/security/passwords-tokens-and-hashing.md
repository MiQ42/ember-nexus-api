# Passwords, Tokens and Hashing

Ember Nexus API uses the following security artefacts:

- Passwords: User specified pieces of text, which usually have a low entropy.
- Hashed passwords: As storing passwords in plaintext is badâ„¢, they are only stored in salted and hashed form.  
  The hash process uses PHP's [password_hash()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) function with
  the `PASSWORD_ARGON2I` preset.
- User passwords are only required for creating new session tokens.
- The session tokens are generated by the API itself, and are of the following format:
  `secret-token:base58(random 16 bytes)`. See also [RFC 8959, the secret-token URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8959.html).
- The session token is sent to the client in plaintext once. The token is internally hashed with SHA-3-256.  
  Note: The token does not require password hashing algorithms like ARGON2I, as the input space has a very high
  entropy already, and brute force attacks on a 256^16 possibility space are currently unsuccessfully slow.
